INSTALL:
	Although I have already made a Windows executable file for you located at "dist" folder which should
	work on Windows 8. But that program will only report to me. So, it is always better to build your own
	program. Instructions are bellow. I hope it will help.

	(a) Open "Settings.py" with notepad or idle. Change it if you want, specially AGENT_HQ_EMAIL_ADDRESSES.
	(b) After installing all the required software, just run "build_spice.bat".
	(c) It will automatically build "Spice.exe" at "dist" folder
	(d) Then run "Spice.exe". Wait for a moment until black command line window disappear.
	(e) Now, there is a new shortcut will appear at the same folder name, "Spice.lnk". Open it.
	(f) Done !!! Now you can delete "Spice.exe" or "Spice.lnk" if you want. From now on, this spice
		program will run silently on every time user logged in to Windows and email to you according to
		"Settings.py"
		
USAGE:
	(a) If you already got email from spice, then I think you also get an attachment called "report.dat".
	(b) Now, save that to your PC, and open "SpiceReportUnlocker.exe" from dist folder.
	(c) Give your "report.dat" location and save location like "report_decrypted.txt".
	(d) It will decrypt the report and you may open that with any text file.
	
	EXAMPLE:
		SPICE REPORT DECRYPTER
		----------------------
		
		-> Please type a path:	D:\Spice Report\report.dat
		-> Save location:		D:\Spice Report\report_decrypted.txt
		[i] MESSAGE: Report saved at D:\Spice Report\report_decrypted.txt
	
	
	
NOTE:	If you are planning to use this, then I want you to say that, I will not take responsibility for
		you action and Good Luck :-)
